# Pipeline Provenance Schema

In order to confidently determine how a genomics analysis result was obtained, we need to collect
information about the processes that were used to generate the analysis outputs. Most genomics
analyses are performed using pipelines that consist of several discrete analysis steps. Each step
may use a specific version of an analysis tool, and produce some outputs that are carried forward
into later analysis steps.

The metadata that is collected about the process of generating a dataset is called data provenance information.
The schema provided in this repo is intended to specify and validate the format of data provenance information
for genomic analysis pipelines.

There are other existing projects that aim to specify this sort of data provenance information, notably
[Research Object](https://www.researchobject.org/) and [cwlprov](https://github.com/common-workflow-language/cwlprov).
Those projects are likely more robust and complete than this schema, but they come with some complexity.

The purpose of this schema is to define a fairly simple standardized format for genomic analysis pipeline
provenance data generated by the pipelines produced by the [BCCDC-PHL](https://github.com/BCCDC-PHL).
It is intended to serve as a standardized interface between pipeline designers/maintainers, and developers
who will be parsing and collecting outputs from BCCDC-PHL genomics analysis pipelines.


## Development Status
This schema is currently in draft status. It may change at any time. Releases will be tagged once some stability has been achived.
